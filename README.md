# binaryConverter

Python code written back in 2017 when I was just starting to learn Computer Science. The code has not been touched since and has been uploaded purely for nostalgia purposes.


## Features

* Converts Binary to Decimal
* Converts Decimal to Binary
* Converts Hexidecimal to Decimal

## Notes
There is a "Decimal to Hexidecimal" option in the code which was never fully added but still present, which I find funny as it showcases what my attention span can be like sometimes.

  Code was written when I was still learning all about binary and hexidecimal during my Computer Science course as a method to do the conversions automatically instead of working them out myself individually. My lecturer approved this method so long as I wrote the code myself, and such this "beautiful" baby was born.
